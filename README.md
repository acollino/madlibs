This app implements the fill-in-the-blank style of word games popularized by the Mad-Libs books.

It utilizes Flask to enable dynamic page generation based on the user's story selection and the user's responses, and it makes use of Jinja to iterate through the responses and display pages as templates. Choosing a story will present the user with a form to complete for each blank in the story, then their responses will complete the story when it is presented to the user.
